The Morska Ruina, or Ruin of the Sea, was a name given to one particular beast that hunted along the coast of [[Zemlja]] south of [[Tradorn]]. A giant serpentine creature that would attack ships that ventured too near the underwater caves we now suspect it was using as a spawning ground. At the time it was discovered it was believed to be a monster born of [[The Shroud]], but it has since been discovered that the Morska Ruina is actually an [[Awakening|Awakened]] animal from the Last Aga.
# Description
 
The Morska Ruina is a limbless and scaled creature similar to a serpent, although its head is less like a snake and closer to some unholy combination of moray eel and wyvern. It is as large around as a humpback whale and longer than ten of them tip to tail. It has rigged scales along its length that are strong enough to deflect most ballista bolts, and large spikes along its spine that can tear through a ship's haul.
# Behavior
 
While it historically has been a danger to ships venturing too close to its caves, in the few years since its children have emerged the Morska Ruina has been seen less and less often, and reports of it attacking ships have stopped all together. We suspect that the previous years of attacks were due to some territorial instinct while its young were still developing. Although that does bring the question of exactly how long it took for these young to develop, considering the attacks went on for decades.

In recent years, the Morska Ruina's children have begun to emerge from the underwater caves it protected. These "Ruinas" as the locals have begun calling them are nowhere near the size of their progenitor. They are closer in size to a large shark, although many times longer. The Ruinas are also considerably more aggressive than their progenitor and hunt in packs of up to a dozen.
 
This is both a blessing and a curse for the people of [[Tradorn]]. The creatures keep the coast clear of many other dangers, and they are a source of materials for those brave enough to hunt them. While at the same time being a danger for any but the fastest or most well armed ship.
