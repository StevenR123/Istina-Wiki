![[Forgers.png]]

The Forgers of [[Wagram]] are a guild of arcane crafters. They are the ones who turn [[Dulmis' Tears]] into artifacts of power.
# History

The Forgers were among the first people to begin experimenting with [[Dulmis' Tears]]. Their founders [[Awakening|Awakened]] through using the tears and we granted ability to Forge artifacts from them. Since then they have expanded their number by [[awakening]] promising craftsmen and teaching them to Forge artifacts.
# Expansion

## [[Tradorn]]

The Forgers have slowly grown in number while keeping a tight grip on their monopoly within Wagram. With the recent discovery of [[Tradorn]], another[[Bastion Cities|Bastion City]], they have begun making plans to expand their guild outside of [[Wagram]].

The few artifact crafters within [[Tradorn]] are isolated "masters" with no strong organization behind them. The Forgers expect to meet only minor resistance.
## [[Kovati]]

[[Kovati]] is an outpost built by the Forgers as proof of the effectiveness of their [[Shroud Beacon|Shroud Beacons]]. It is the first permanent settlement built outside of a [[Bastion Cities|Bastion City]] to survive more than a few weeks.

Since it's creation less than a year ago the Forgers have been steadily moving their operations into this mountain outpost and out of the control of [[Wagram]]. Already most their Master Forgers live there full time and their Beacon production is now exclusively at the outpost.
# Creations

While no artifact of power can be called commonplace there are those that fall into general categories that are common amongst artifacts.

These include various weapons that are imbued with power and material that is imbued with extreme durability.

These are things most crafters that have [[Awakening|Awakened]] can achieve early in their development.

The items listed here are specifically advancements in arcane crafting achieved by the Forgers themselves.
## [[Shroud Beacon|Shroud Beacons]]

These arcane devices are able to create permanent pockets of protection from [[The Shroud]] outside of the [[Bastion Cities]]. The secret of their creation is known only to the Forgers.
## [[Piercing Lens]]

Piercing Lens are crafted from the waste material of arcane crafting. While their use is now well known they were first discovered by the Forgers.
