![[Titan Guard.png]]

The Titan guard was originally the remnants of the Sleeping Titan's army when he conquered Wagram centuries before Dulmis' Sacrifice. The were an occupying force made up almost exclusively by Orcs.

In the time since as the Titan slept they slowly integrated into the city as residents and morphed into something closer to a city guard force. Although their origin as followers of the Sleeping Titan has remained a strong point of pride they now include many non-orcs among their ranks so long as they are devotees of the Titan.
