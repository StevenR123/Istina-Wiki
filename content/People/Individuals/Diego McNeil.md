# History

Diego was once an explorer and treasure hunter. He mapped out a large area of the [[Glasside Mountains]] and found and sold at least three of [[Dulmis' Tears]].

His days of adventure ended after he and his companions discovered the [[Glasside Giant]]. The statue was found in an unexplored valley. As the group approached it they began to feel a sense of dread. Diego volunteered to approach closer than the others were willing to in an attempt to discover what the statue was. Once he was within about 100 yards he lost himself into some kind of unnatural panic. His companions had to restrain him before he ran into the wilds alone.

He had to carried for several days back to [[Wagram]]. His panic did not stop until he was behind the Bastion's walls.
# Retirement

Diego never ventured past the walls of [[Wagram]] again. He now spends his days living off his accumulated wealth and drinking in taverns across the city. They say he has nervous demeanor now and that sometimes he just stares off to the north and mutters to himself.
