Thirza and her fellow hunter ventured deep within the [[Glasside Mountains]] to the newly discovered and unnamed ruin. They explored the ruin, slaying the many monster within, and collecting treasures from The Last Age.

From the start of their exploration Thirza began to feel as if she was being watched. As they moved deeper she seemed to be growing just a little faster, a little stronger, and a little tougher. At the same time her companion grew slow, weak, and frail. The effects were slow and incrimental but by the time they reached the end of the ruin it was undeniable.
