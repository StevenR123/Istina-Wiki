![[The Scribe (Current).png]]
# Introduction

It is beyond odd to be writing one of these entries on myself, but needs must. I will refrain from my normal air of objectivity as it would seem too disingenuous when telling you about myself.

I am The Scribe. I made a deal with the 'World Spirit,' as you would call it, an incomprehensibly long time ago. The details of which are both extensive and not something I'm willing to fully leave behind here.
# Method

The short of it is that I get to keep my memories whenever I am reborn, I have magical gifts that allow me to explore and examine the world in ways you could not imagine, and all I need to do in exchange is write reports on my findings in these tombs.

My method of exploring is confidential, but I will say the reports I write are an amalgam of both my direct observations and... first-hand accounts from locals. This is why the tone and perspective of the reports tend to shift. There is a certain level bleed over from the reports of locals inherent in my method, leading to idiosyncrasies, such as referring to the entity known as [[Dulmis]] as "Our Lord Dulmis".

I do occasionally add notes from my own perspective, but I make sure they are clearly distinguishable from the report proper. Most of these notes are hidden from normal observation.

I must say this version of the world has been rather interesting to examine. I do hope that if I die in the next few years, I will not spend too many decades away from it.
