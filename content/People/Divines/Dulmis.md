![[Dulmis.png]]

Our Lord Dulmis was the eldest and most powerful god. He led the other gods in an endless battle to prevent [[Those Outside]] from reentering our world.

In the end he sacrificed himself and all the other gods to prevent [[Those Outside]] from interfering with the world once and for all. Upon his sacrifice the world was destroyed and reborn into what it is today.

Even in death he provides us his [[Dulmis' Tears|Tears]] so that we may gain strength to defend ourselves.
