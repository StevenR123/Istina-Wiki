## The First Blessing

![[Dorian - First Blessing.png]]

It is said that Dorian's mother gave birth to him in the hull of a ship during a storm of titanic proportions. She died doing so, and he was left to the care of the superstitious sailors.

It was widely believed that a child whose mother died during their birth was cursed. The sailors could neither keep the child with them nor kill it for fear of the curse. They offered the child to their nameless goddess of storms, and she sent her lightning to claim him. It is said when he was struck he ceased his crying and so to did the raging of the sea.

The goddess had sent her lighting to kill the child and claim his soul, but Dorian was not killed. He was burned, he was scared, and he would still have died after hours of suffering had it not been for the sailors that offered the babe to his goddess. When Dorian survived the lighting strike, the sailors knew it was their duty to care for the child, for rather than being cursed he was blessed by the Storm.
## The Second Blessing

Dorian spent his first two decades on the same ship he was born on. He was raised by the crew in their nomadic ways. He learned to travel between the Hundred Isles and the Emerald Continent, and he learned the thousand songs sung to The Storm. He learned how he had come to be with his people and that his scars were a blessing given to him by The Storm herself.

It was then at the end of his youth that the men clad in metal suits and riding Wyverns came from deep within the Emerald Continent and began to attack the Hundred Isles. His ship's crew went to aid in the war, and he was always the first amongst the charge.

During one of the largest battles, his ship was attacked by their enemy's leader. Their king sitting in a small fortress atop the only true Dragon he'd ever seen. The beast sunk his ship and doomed his crew to death, but the Dragon had grabbed Dorian from the prow of his ship as he screamed his defiance. It flew high into the bright sky, ready to devour him.

And from that stormless sky a pillar of lightning appeared, consuming the Dragon and the foolish king that rode it. All those on the battlefield were blinded by the light, and the image of a Dorian floating in the pillar of white burned into their eyes for the rest of their lives.
## The Third Blessing

From the day of the battle on he was able to call lightning to strike his enemies and winds to fill his sails. In the years that followed, Dorian became the leader of his people. He was blessed by The Storm and had even called her to himself to kill the king.

He led a great host to decimate the kingdom that had attacked his people. He stuck their beasts from the sky and watered the earth with their blood, but he was no conqueror. Once the kingdom was no longer a threat, he took his people back to their Isles and helped them rebuild.

His body grew old during his long life of peace until the day Those Outside came from the stars themselves. They tore through his people as if they were nothing more than wheat for the harvest. When they made their way to him, his body was too frail to fight them off. He died an ignoble death to a projectile fired from more than a mile away before he ever saw his enemy.

But as his body died, The Storm stretched herself across the sky, turning midday into a lightless void. With a crack of sound heard for a thousand thousand miles she poured herself into a single strike of lightning that hit Dorian's body and transformed it. He rose not as a man, but as a storm given human shape.

Dorian Thrice Blessed of The Storm wore a hurricane on his back and poured lightning upon his enemies like rain. He destroyed every foul creature within his sight and stuck down those few from Outside that tried to flee back into the stars. And in a flash he disappeared.

Now the wind sings no songs, the rain drums no beat, and The Storm heeds no calls.
# Current Day

Dorian Thrice Blessed has been worshiped by an island community since before the Last Age. His worshipers were always isolated and small in number, but they have persisted even through [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]].

The Bastion City of [[Sokarz]] is the current epicenter of his worship. Like with all the [[Bastion Cities]] there is a statue at the center of the city, although there was not one before [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]].

The statue depicts a man with deep grooves similar to overlapping lightning all over his body, and although there is no name plastered to the statue the Dorianites have been worshiping it has their god come back to them.

One small oddity of note is that although all other known [[Bastion Cities]] have a group of at least 4 statues at their center, this one stands alone.
