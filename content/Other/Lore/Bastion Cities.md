Bastion Cities are the only large settlements that persisted through the rebirth of the world. They are entirely clear of [[The Shroud]] and seem to repel most of the monstrous creatures of the wilds.

They are each said to be under the divine protection of a small pantheon of demi-gods although no creditable source has seen these being. Many, but not all, of these Bastion Cities have an alter at their center with stone statues of their pantheon. This is notable because there is often no record of these alters existing before the rebirth.
