> Craftsmen,

> I shall make this missive a brief one, as there is little time to waste on pleasantries.
> 
> You have crafted something of great utility, and I wish to purchase the method of its creation. I am from a city far far from yours and have no interest in your affairs nor do I plan to sell, donate, or use your beacon design within your sphere of influence. I will swear any oaths magical or otherwise, and sign any contract you construct baring me from doing just that.
> 
> I am willing to offer you a generous sum in whatever form of payment you desire. I can provide you designs of my own, rare metals, precious gems, and crates full of tears. Whatever you wish, I will provide it in exchange for your method.
> 
> Please consider my offer and when you desire to negotiate all you need do is find a man by the name of [[Ashok Achari]] within [[Wagram]] and tell him to arrange a meeting with his patron.
> 
> Your servant,
