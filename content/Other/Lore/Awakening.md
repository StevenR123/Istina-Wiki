# Summary

Awakening is what we call the process of connecting to the arcane power of the world.
The results of Awakening vary between individuals. Generally it imparts some kind of supernaturally augmented ability related to the person that was Awakened and the ability to improve and expand these supernatural gifts with time and effort.

The only known way to Awaken is to consume the power held within [[Dulmis' Tears]].
## Animals

Animals are known to be able to awaken through the same process, although the supernatural augments they awaken are often more extreme and tend to alter their physical form much more often than in humans. The other main difference is that some version of the supernatural gift is usually passed down to their descendants.
## Monsters

Monsters born from [[The Shroud]] are inherently supernatural and are thought to not need any specific awakening like mortal creatures. It is however speculated that they can consume [[Dulmis' Tears]] to enhance themselves directly. This is the common explanation given for some of the titanic monsters that are occasionally found.
## The Last Age

While [[Dulmis' Tears]] are the only currently known way to Awaken it is well known that in the Last Age, before [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]], there were many ways to Awaken. It is believed that many of those paths to power were crafted by [[Dulmis]] himself, and that they were broken with his death.
