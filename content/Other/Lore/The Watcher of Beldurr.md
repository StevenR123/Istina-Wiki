# Priesthood
 
The people of [[Beldurr]] hold to an ancient tradition of ancestor worship rather than worshiping any gods. The Watcher of Beldurr is a title given to whichever member of the priesthood holds the [[Watcher's Spear]].
 
They believe that the "Pantheon" represented by the statues at the center of their city are actually Demons from Outside that are waiting to emerge from their rest and devour the world. Thus, they created the [[Watcher's Spear]] and the position of The Watcher to monitor them and strike them down should they wake.
 
The Watcher's main responsibility is to monitor the statues within the fortified temple at the heart of [[Beldurr]]. They are a sentry and guard who must always be ready to sound the alarm before striking down the Demons should they wake.

The position of The Watcher is passed on daily among a group of [[Awakening|Awakened]] warrior priests. These priests train among themselves whenever they are not in possession of the [[Watcher's Spear]] to always be at their peak fighting condition. When the alarm is sounded by The Watcher, all the priests will swarm the Demons in an attempt to slay them.

## [[Watcher's Spear|Spear of The Watcher]]

The Spear of The Watcher is a powerful Artifact imbued with a massive amount of power. It is said to have been crafted from a dozen of Dulmis' Tears refined into their purest form by a master crafter from the Last Age.

Although its powers are not known publicly, it is said that even being within the same room as the spear is enough to force the breath out of the lungs of the [[Awakening|Unawakened]].

## [[Eyes of The Watcher]]

These amulets are crafted within the priesthood and held only by its members. They are known to grant the ability to share senses amongst the priesthood. The reason they were crafted is so the moment The Watcher sees the Demon's wake, all of the priesthood would know.
