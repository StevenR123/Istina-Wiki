The Shroud is a dark fog that covers most of the would outside the [[Bastion Cities]]. It never disappears, but it does ebb and flow in density seemingly at random.

The monsters born of The Shroud are almost all predatory and hunt people foolish enough to go into The Shroud unprepared.

Many animals live within The Shroud. The [[Awakening|Unawakened]] animals are seemingly ignored by the monsters, although the awakened animals are perused the same as humans.

The only thing known to be able to push back the shroud are the [[Bastion Cities]] themselves and [[Shroud Beacon|Shroud Beacons]] crafted from [[Dulmis' Tears]].
