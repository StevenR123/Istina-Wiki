![[Dulmis_ Tears.png]]

[[Dulmis]]' Tears fall from the sky as blue meteors. What remains when they land are chunks of a glowing blueish metal.

They are the only thing able to be crafted into magical artifacts and are the catalyst to [[Awakening|Awaken]]. It is also speculated that they can be used by monsters to enhance their own powers.

They are said to be our Lord [[Dulmis]]' final gift to us before he ended the world. They began falling shortly after [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]] and have continued to occasionally fall from the skies.
