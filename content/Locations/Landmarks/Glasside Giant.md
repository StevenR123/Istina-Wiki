![[The Glasside Giant.png]]
# Description
Deep in the [[Glasside Mountains]] there is a valley with a gigantic unmoving figure made of metal. The figure seems to be a kneeling humanoid of impossible size with an equally large weapon in one hand.

To all mundane sense it appears to be nothing more than a metal statue. However those blessed in the Arcane report a deep well of magic coming from the statue, and anyone who approaches within several hundred yards report a sense of dread that increases with proximity.

 
# [[Diego McNeil]]
The explorer, Diego McNeil, is believed to be the person that has gotten closest to the statue. When he found the statue he left his companions at a distance as he approached. His companions report that once he got within 100 yards, he seemed to enter a state of panic and fled the way he had come. He had to be captured and restrained lest he run into [[The Shroud]]. What follows is a direct quote as reported by the explorers of what the man was muttering between sobs.

 
> It knows... It knows... Watching... It sees me... It knows me
> â€” Diego McNeil
 
The state of panic lasted for days until the group were behind the walls of a [[Bastion Cities|Bastion City]].
