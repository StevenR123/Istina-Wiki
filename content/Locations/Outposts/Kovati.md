# Founding

Kovati is the first permeant outpost beyond the [[Bastion Cities]] that has been able to survive. This is exclusively due to the use of [[Shroud Beacon]]'s which act to mimic the protective qualities of the [[Bastion Cities]] against [[The Shroud]] and what lurks within it.

Built into the [[Glasside Mountains]] this mostly underground outpost was built by the [[Forgers]] of [[Wagram]] to act as a proof that their [[Shroud Beacon|Shroud Beacons]] worked as intended. However, in the 6 months that the outpost has stood, the [[Forgers]] have begun to move more and more of their operations into it. It already acts as a secondary headquarters for their guild and houses most of their experimental forging. It seems likely they will soon be operating mainly out of it rather than [[Wagram]] itself.

# Operations

## Beacon Production

The majority of master Forgers spend their efforts crafting [[Shroud Beacon|Shroud Beacons]] deep within Kovati. It is clear that these artifacts are the most important invention the [[Forgers]] have made and will be needed for every government, company, guild, or organization looking to do anything outside the severely limited space within the [[Bastion Cities]].

The [[Forgers]] plan to expand their own operations far and wide before providing significant numbers of beacons to anyone.

## Training

With the new opportunities for the [[Forgers]] to expand with both the discovery of [[Tradorn]] and the creation of the beacons recruitment has skyrocketed.

Promising craftsmen that have been turned away in years past have been invited to Kovati to receive training before [[Awakening]]. These men and women are being taught the basics of arcane craftsmanship for free, and the best of them are being added to the ranks of the [[Forgers]] so that they can handle the more tedious tasks that waste the time of the Master Forgers.

Although no official designation exists, these members of the [[Forgers]] are treated as lesser members. They hold none of the sway of the older
