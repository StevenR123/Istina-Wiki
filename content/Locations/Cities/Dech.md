# Overview
 
Dech is a [[Bastion Cities|Bastion City]] that sits on an island off the north east coast of [[Zemlja]]. It is mainly inhabited by Hobgoblins, Humans, and [[Bi-Pole]] although there are several smaller minorities including Axolgons.

The city itself is built into the many rocky pillars of the island. At it's heart there is a plateau where the original settlement was left after [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]]. The city itself has expanded rapidly to edge of the protection from [[The Shroud]].
## Bi-Pole

The first thing anyone would notice about Dech is the large number of people walking around with large flowers blooming on their heads. These are all part of the hivemind known as [[Bi-Pole]].

They are in are largely in control of running the city although they do share power with a council of elders. This has been the status quo since [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]] although they existed in the city during the Last Age.

Their arrangement with the other inhabitants is that they are given the body of anyone who dies so that they can create more of the drones that can be seen all over the city. In exchange [[Bi-Pole]] has the drones handle most of the manual labor, administration, and a large portion of the defense of the city.

 
## History

The city of Dech was originally a Hobgoblin village named Tagac Dech deep within a swamp long before [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]]. During the end of the Last Age the group that would become their pantheon took control of the village after freeing it from the rule of an incompetent chief.

The village's infrastructure was greatly improved while the new leaders began accepting more and more refuges from the human empire to the north. This is also when [[Bi-Pole]] was accepted into the settlement and given much of they're responsibilities and power.

Right before the end of the Age the leader's finished the construction of a Gate leading to a far flung settlement where Mallory's, one of the leaders, people were. They moved the inhabitants of that settlement to the city while maintaining the Gate in hopes of having a stable connection last into the New Age.

After [[Dulmis' Sacrifice]] statues of the leaders were found facing the empty frame of the Gate in the center of the city.
